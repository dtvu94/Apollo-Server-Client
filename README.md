# Apollo-Server-Client
Study Apollo Server and Apollo Client (React)

Step to run each self-implement project:
- npm install

For server:
- node index.js

For client:
- npm start

The referenced projects have README file inside them. Please take instructions from these file.

I acknowledge very much authors of these projects.

I keep the original status in zipped files.

Hence you find an initial project repository for each of them.
